    question: "Can my whole team use it?",
    answer: "Yes. You control who sees what through role-based permissions. Crew members see their schedules, project managers see project details, and you see everything.",

  {
    question: "Will this work when I'm running multiple projects?",
    answer: "Yes. Handoff is built to help you scale. The more projects you run, the more valuable the automated coordination becomes. You can manage 3x more projects when you delegate admin work to your AI teammate.",
